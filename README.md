# Autoencoder-on-MNIST-dataset
Classification on MNIST dataset consisting of 28x28 greyscale images of handwritten digits. The dataset is split into a training
set of 60 000, and a validation set of 10 000 labeled instances.

# What I learned:
- <b>Use and Apllication of the following Python libraries/packages:
  1. Numpy
  2. Matplotlib
  3. Pytorch

- <b>Implementation of a simple neural network from scratch in Python, including weight updates via backpropagation.
- <b>Principle and working of Autoencoders.
- <b>Plotting Loss vs epoch for illustrating the comparision between Training Error vs Validation Error.
